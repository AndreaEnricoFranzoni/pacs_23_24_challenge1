README is clear and complete. I would expect you to tell me what choice of the parameters is not good, since you have noticed it.

Code organization:
    You should give more explicative names to files, for instance the types_def only implements one struct and could be named adter it, as you did with parameters.
    I would expect all the header files to be collected into an include foalder.

Why did you implement the function ex_grad_chosen, returning its input?

You didn't need that complex structure for the function numDeriv, because you only need the first derivatives for the gradient:
    - no need for higher derivatives
    - no need for template
    - no need for inline

You also don't need the template T in the other functions: it is double.

Where did you use the function algo_used?
